        <h2>Return Policy</h2>
        <p>We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If you are not happy with your order for any reason, you can return it within 30 days of the delivery date for a full refund or exchange. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging with all tags attached.</p>
        <p>To initiate a return, please visit our online returns portal or contact our customer support team with your order number.</p>

        <h2>Exchange Policy</h2>
        <p>If you need to exchange an item for a different size or color, please follow the return process for the original item and place a new order for the desired item. This ensures you get your new item as quickly as possible.</p>

        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If you are approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within 7-10 business days.</p>
